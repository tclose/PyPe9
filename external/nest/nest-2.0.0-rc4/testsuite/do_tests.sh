# function run_testscript
#
#   Synopsis: run_testscript <scriptname>
#
#   Description:
#     The function runs the NEST binary with the SLI script
#     <scriptname>.
#     The exit code is then transformed into a human readable string
#     (if possible) using the global variables (successcodes) and
#     (failcodes) which contain a comma separated list of exit codes
#     and strings describing the the exit code.
#     If either (successcodes) or (failcodes) contain an entry for the
#     exit code, the respective string is logged, and the test is
#     either counted as passed or failed.
#     If neither (successcodes) nor (failcodes) contains an entry !=
#     "" for the returned exit code, the pass is counted as failed,
#     too, and "unexpected exit code is logged).
#     
#   Parameters:
#     <scriptname>: Name of a .sli script in $testsuite_basedir/tests/
#
#   Used global variables:
#     result: string that records all test results.
#     (successcodes): variable that contains an explanation string for 
#                     all exit codes that are to be regarded as a success.
#     (failcodes): variable that contains an explanation string for 
#                  all exit codes that are to be regarded as a failure.
#     Examples:
#       successcodes=" 0 Success"
#       failcodes=" 1 Failed: missed assertion,"\
#       " 2 Failed: error in tested code block,"\
#       " 3 Failed: tested code block failed to fail,"\
#       " 126 Failed: error in test script"
